class **_Router_** created for initializing methods for working
with a class **_Resource_** that extends class **_PostsController_**.
Actually used `extend`, because class **_Resource_** added method `connection`
to a class, but not to an instance.
Added methods to class **_PostsController_** and refactor code
for more friendly response to user.
